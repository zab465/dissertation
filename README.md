This repository contains the replication materials for the paper "which factors affect the types of crimes committed by terrorist organizations as part of their funding campaign?"

The data used for this project is found in the data folder, except the International Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events which is bound by a licence agreement. Some data files are therefore missing from the data collection, and the relational database used for some operations is also not included. 

Figures and tables from the main analysis and the sensitivity analysis are also included (both code and outputs).
